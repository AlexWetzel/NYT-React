### Instructions

On the home page, enter a topic in the text field, then hit the search button to query the New York Times database. The results will dispay in separate panels in the 'Results' section. These panels have an article headline, a publish date, a link to the full article, and a 'Save' button.

Saving an article lets you view it later on the saved article page. These articles will be visible to anyone who visits the site. To remove the article, hit the 'Delete' button on the panel.
