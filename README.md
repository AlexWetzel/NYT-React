A News article search app built with React, using the News API.

### Instructions

On the home page, enter a topic in the text field, then hit the search button to query the News API database. Up to 10 results will display under the search panel. Each article will display with a title, a short snippet of the full article with a link to the source, a publish date, and a save button.

Saving an article lets you view it later on the saved article page. These articles will be visible to anyone who visits the site. To remove the article, hit the 'Delete' button on the panel.

### Special Thanks
